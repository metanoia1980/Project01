File sharing and learning Github.

Have a quick look at the Screenshot.png file, see if you like it.

Not so much a project but rather an attempt to learn Github by uploading my first "project".

I am new to Linux and have enjoyed playing around with these 3 config files I am sharing here. 

1- .bashrc

2- .nanorc

3- config.cong (for neofetch) 

I have since changed from kitty to Tilix. Its ASCII only, but I LOVE Tilix. 

Suggestions, tips, or any feedback in general(constructive or not) regarding my .bashrc file will be much appreciated.   

I also enjoyed changing the icons on Debian 12(Bookworm). I am sharing the icons here too and they are pretty straight forward to change on /usr/share/applications. Find the *Appname*.desktop file, sudo edit it with nano, vim etc, change the icon path to the path of your chosen icon.

The Bash icon, Librewolf, Discord, Softwares(the Penguin) and Settings will instantly change once you save the file with the new path. Nautilus however will require *nautilus -q* on the terminal since not even restarting the system will do it.

Thank you.
